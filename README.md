## Hello!
My name is Greg, I work in C.

I like keeping things small, simple, and fast.
When I write software, I try to use these ideas to make my C code readable.

## My philosophy
If you want to succeed, you *need* to be prepared for the long game.
There are no shortcuts without compromise, I am still learning new things every single day :)

When you're trying to learn a new skill, find someone reputable above all else!
When you don't know something, you are vulnerable to misinformation and may not understand why something is incorrect.
I highly endorse Donald Knuth and those who uphold the ideals that held Unix together such as Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.

## The Golem Programming Language
I am active in writing the specification for a programming language designed in the wake of C.
Golem upholds performance more than anything else, but does not compromise in readability and conveying complex ideas in succinct ways.
The language is designed to implement a new way of installing software through an intermediate language that can be natively compiled easily.
This intermediate language, when compiled by the user, will create software specifically designed for their computer using native assembly instructions that may not work on other computers.
Furthermore, this language allows for quick recompilation with the intermediate representation along with the experimental 'module' system.

If it wasn't obvious, it is a very ambitious specification.
